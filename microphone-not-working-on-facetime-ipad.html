            <h1 itemprop="headline">Microphone Not working on FaceTime iPad</h1>
            <p><a href="/tips.html">Back</a></p>
            
            <p>Show you
                How you can fix the situation when the microphone doesn't
                On your Facetime call, the microphone doesn't work. That's why many people
                are facing this problem.
                Now, before we go on and show you the
                the basic process, here are the things that you
                have to be careful with.</p>
            <p class="center"><img style="max-width: 400px" width="100%" src="https://www.ipadpromanuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ipad-pro.png" alt="Microphone Not working on FaceTime iPad" /></p>
            <p>First, make sure that your mute button
                has not been turned on the button
                on your Facetime call while you're
                talking to someone.
                If it is on, go ahead and turn it off.
                Now, after that, all you want to do is just
                open the settings
                and scroll down to bluetooth, make sure.
                Be sure to turn bluetooth on if
                you ask why.
                If your ipad is connected to any other
                bluetooth device, your microphone will not
                work from your ipad.</p>
            <p>The microphone will work from
                No matter what device your ipad is connected to
                Connected to make sure you have turned on the bluetooth and
                After that check if your process
                is working or not.
                Thirdly, make sure there is a stable internet connection
                on your ipad now, if you have or if you see that your ipad has or is working just a bad internet connection, all you need to do is swipe down and turn on air mode and wait about 10 seconds and then just go ahead and bring it back. Turn it off and after that check to see if you are having trouble talking to someone else.</p>
            <p>See solution on youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/v90_tkcvZkU" target="_blank">FIX: Microphone Not working on FaceTime iPad!</a></p>
            <p>Using your facetime call now after that
                Let's say I tried all the ways,
                which didn't work, but last but not least.
                What you can do
                Just go ahead and make
                restaurant settings on your ipad
                to solve this problem, so you just need to
                type in the settings
                and scroll down to general. Then
                Scroll down to the reset options
                and now go ahead and hit reset all
                settings and enter the
                screen time password. And after that
                it will give you this prompt, go ahead
                and press or reset
                and do it again, and once you do that.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                Just turned on, everything is fine. Guys, now after

                and enter your
