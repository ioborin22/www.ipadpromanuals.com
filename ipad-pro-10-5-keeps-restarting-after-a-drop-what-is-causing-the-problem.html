            <h2>iPad pro keeps restarting</h2>
            <p>we will be working on an ipad pro 10.5 inches
            The ipad would reboot every few minutes, so
            we thought it was a software problem.
            So we did a software update
            It didn't help.</p>

            <p>The screen crashed the client did a software update
            update or restore, which did not solve the
            problem with the reboot, and the customer replaced the
            the actual screen.
            This is the right solution to see if
            That would solve the problem, but it didn't solve the problem.
            What I want to do is a quick physical
            inspection of the board to see if there is anything obvious
            Since this tablet was suffering from a drip. We
            Look for possibly broken coil parts.</p>
            <h2>Coil repair</h2>
            <p>I've seen this happen with coils and
            right there.
            A bell has broken and I've seen it more than once when a
            the coil is either untied or ripped out of the board
            we can still see the edge of the component here.
            It's not the soldering that's broken, it's the actual component that's more of a
            problem.
            I have a donor tip here, this is a donor tip ipad pro 10.5
            that we have, and we're going to use
            the coil with this one and put it on.</p>

            <p>The first thing I want to do is distract.
            These broken pieces and let's also remove this
            we're going to add some solder.
            What I want to do now is grab the
            component from the donor board.
            I have a donor board right here.
            Let's use hot air and solder that component
            onto the client board.</p>

            <p>All that's left to do is assemble it and test it.
            So, assembled the board and said this
            no.
            The tablet is still rebooting, I'm going to
            take another look at the board, just
            to see if there's anything else that we
            might have missed.</p>

            <p>Quickly saw that we are missing a
            coils, so I replaced it and put it back in.
            Now I want to continue the physical inspection.
            The actual legs, pads, and solder
            are very solid, but the component itself
            The coil itself the connection between the bell and
            Not as strong.
            So if you hit it, you could lose the coil or
            the bell can become loose or broken.
            At this point, we haven't seen the bell inside the
            tablet, but that's probably because the
            customer
            replaced the screen, and that coil probably
            most likely fell out without the customer's attention
            Without noticing that it's a tiny component.</p>

            <p class="center"><img style="max-width: 400px" width="100%" src="https://www.ipadpromanuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ipad-keeps.png" alt="iPad pro keeps restarting " /></p>
            <h2>Examination of the IPAD</h2>
            <p>So I'm doing a more thorough physical inspection of the
            board to see if we have
            anything else
            So far everything looks clean.
            I want to check these calls, I'm going to
            check every single coil
            just to make sure we don't have
            anything loose.
            This is the one we swapped.</p>

            <p>The three missing coils on the same board.
            This shows how important the physical
            verification.
            Okay, I won't be able to place my
            tweezers on this section of the board, so
            let's use our regular
            tweezers.
            Let's start by preparing the overlays, just
            a little
            Now we're going to take the coil from the
            the donor board, let me make sure
            that we're taking the right coil.
            It's on the right side of this chip and here it is.</p>

            <p>Okay, that's one. And let's do the other
            The one in the middle.
            And let's solder it to the client
            circuit board.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>So the screen is assembled, I haven't
            haven't turned it on yet, I still have the
            the battery is separated from the motherboard.
            so we need to
            remove the separator and push the
            on the battery connector and let's turn it on.
            and the tablet turns on for usually
            two seconds three seconds it turns off
            and it reboots.
            It will work without rebooting great I never got to the
            screen.
            Always apple logo one two seconds off.
            apple logo one two seconds off right now
            it booted up to the operating system</p>
