            <ol>

                    battery is still 50%. Well, it is not allowed to charge your phone if its battery life has not been
                    low. It is suggested to charge your iPad if its battery is about 5%. Do not over charge your iPad

                    iPad battery so that it will be best if you turn off that application. Go to the setting icon,
                    choose general which then selects the background app refresh to turn off.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Turn down the brightness</strong>. Many old people always turn up the brightness of the
                    phone because it will make them clearer to see the background. However, turning up the iPad
                    background also will consume much battery. Therefore, it is wise to turn down the brightness if you
                    want to save your battery.

                below.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>App service</strong>. Do you always use and turn on the app such as Bluetooth, maps,
                    location, and Wi-Fi? Then, let you think about turning off those applications because those apps
                    will drain your battery life. However, if you need those apps, you may turn them on but do not
                    forget to turn off after you finish using them.

                <li><strong>Airplane mode</strong>. It is better to turn on the Airplane mode if you do not use your
                    iPad for a few hour because it might be the way to save your battery longer.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Other apps</strong>. iPad has such the Apple store to download many other apps including the
                    games, the dictionary, etc. If it is not needed, do not download those applications because they may
                    take a lot of space which can drain the battery.
