            <h2>Simple Ways to Keep iPad Runs Faster</h2>
            <p>There are many things that you have to do to keep your iPad Pro runs faster. Here, in this following
                points,
                are ways you must do.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Update Apps and iOS. iOS must be updated as well because it may avoid your tablet from being
                    infected by bugs. By having the iOS updated, your phone may run even smoother than before. Moreover,
                    it may include new features and security updated as well. Try to rely on the automatic updated if
                    you feel lazy.
                </li>
                <li>Seldom apps. Do you keep the apps you seldom use on your iPad? Then, let you delete those apps
                    because they are useless. Also, they may ruin the battery of your tablet; it could drain and shorten
                    the iPad battery life. The game you rarely play, or the social media you never open, let you delete
                    them.
                </li>
                <li>Music, video, and pictures. Music, video, and pictures must take a lot of space on your iPad Pro.
                    You might be able to check it on your iPad if you do not believe. Therefore, if it is possible, you
                    need to delete or uninstall those <a
                            href="/knowing-ipad-pro-how-use-two-apps.html">apps</a> if you
                    rarely listen to the music, etc.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Another Ways to Keep iPad Runs Faster</strong>

            <p>If you would like to make your iPad Pro runs faster, you have to do all of these tips which are going to
                be
                explained below.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Safari history. If you would like to browse the internet, you must use such particular browser such
                    as Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Dolphin browser, etc. to find the information you are going to search
                    about. Well, when you have finished browsing the internet, let you remove the safari history to
                    fasten the performance of your iPad.
                </li>
                <li>Cookies. Same as the safari history, cookies may make the iPad runs slower because it has many
                    caches which may drain the battery, too. Thus, to avoid from making your iPad slows down, you should
                    clean up the cookies.
                </li>
                <li>Message. Having too many messages may irritate anyone because sometimes, it may make the storage
                    full. You need to delete those messages if you think they are not very important to you. If you
                    would like to save the message, you can transfer the message via iMessage.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In the end, iPad Pro still becomes number one among the people because it is kind of special tablet from
                Apple Company.</p>
