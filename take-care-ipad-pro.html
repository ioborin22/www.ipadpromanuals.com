            <ol>
                <li>Buy a screen protector and a case. The first thing you have to do when you have bought new iPad Pro
                    is purchasing the iPad case and its screen protector. These two things are beneficial to avoid any
                    damage or physical harm when you carelessly drop your iPad.
                </li>
                <li>Use the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204060">Passcode
                    Lock Function</a>. As you buy iPad, you must not want anyone else, but you use it. Therefore, you
                    need to do something to keep your privacy. Setting the Passcode lock function will be a good idea.
                    You just need to go to the setting icon, turn the Passcode on and set it as you want.
                </li>

                    file. Then, you might be frustrated and do not know what to do to get your file back. If you back up
                    your phone often, you could overcome problems such as failed iOS upgrade, mistaken deletion,
                    troubled data transferring, etc.
