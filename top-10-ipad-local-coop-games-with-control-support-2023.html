      <p>Check out these 10 local or split-screen iPad games that offer device co-op gameplay with controller support.</p>

      <h2>Arcade Racing Game</h2>
      <p>At number 10, we have a tabletop world tour of racing. Here youâ€™ll find an arcade racing game where you and a buddy can drive tiny mini cars on tables. Playing split-screen is a breeze; just connect two controllers to your iPad.</p>

      <p>Go to multiplayer from the main menu, and from there, you can play split-screen online or offline battles. You can pick your favorite track, decide on the number of laps, turn on/off AI opponents, enable or disable pair updates, and more. Coming in at number nine is Death Squared, first released on PC and console a few years ago by SMG Studios.</p>

      <h2>Death Square: A Puzzle Game Now on iOS</h2>

      <p>This game, perfect for one or two players, combines teamwork with robot explosions. Using two controllers, one player will control the red robot, and the other will control the blue robot. You must work together through 80 levels, trying not to interfere with each other's robots. The voice acting adds a fun touch, and at $5.99, Death Square is well worth checking out. Please note that the game doesn't fit the full-screen resolution of the new iPad Pro.</p>
